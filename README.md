# Python-for-data-analysis
ESILV - Python for data analysis - project 2022
by:
Chanelle Wea and Suvin Sasikumar 

The goal of this project is to create: 

1. A PowerPoint explaining the ins and outs of the problem, your thoughts on the asked
question, the different variables you created, how the problem fits in the context of the
study.     
-> the powerpoint we created is called : PROJECT  PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS.pdf

2. A code in python:
  a) Data-visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh ...): show the link between
  the variables and the target.
  b) Modeling: use the scikit-learn library to try several algorithms, change the
  hyper parameters, do a grid search, compare the results of your models using
  graphics.
-> we created a jupyter notebook (which is called : Chanelle_Wea_Suvin_Sasikumar_notebook_project.ipynb
  You will find all the code in this notebook. We added a HTML version of this notebook too.
  
3. Transformation of the model into an API of your choice (Django or flask).
-> we created an API on Django, with visual studio code.
How to use the API ?
- Open Visual Studio Code, and open the file "my site" 
- open a new terminal command line
- write this code on the terminal C:\Users\Desktop\Django ML\mysite> python manage.py runserver
- you will obtain a link to a html website : http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- copie and paste it to an internet navigator.

- Now you can use our API ! You have to enter all the details asked, and our machine Learning model will predict if your compagny is  going to bankrupt or not !
